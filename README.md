# Malloc

This project implements 2 versions of both malloc and free in C. It implements a First Fit and a Best Fit methodology of both. Included is a Makefile that compiles a shared library that can use each implementation. A PDF file also explaisn the performance of each implementation. The test.c and test.h files were used to simply test out the functionality of both functions.
